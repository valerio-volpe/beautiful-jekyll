We present breafly the trolls which represent the protagonists of our story and which can be considered as the most representative Italian trolls.

### FAVA LORENA

With her 2918 tweets, she can be considered as our most active character on social media. The subjects being highlighted are innumerable. Some of them are related to social problems (such as pollution), indignations (arms sales) and opposition to political actions. Furthermore, 1LORENAFAVA1 attacks both *left* and *right* parties, stressing social problems: this is coherent with *Five-Star Movement* ideas. Indeed, from the geographical analysis we will present in the next section we can see that 1LORENAFAVA1 wrote tweets mentions South Italy regions, where the *Five-Star Movement* coalition won the elections.

### GUIDI VITTORE

With 1656 tweets, VITTOREGUIDI is another important character. His tweets are less than Lorenaâ€™s ones, but spread over a longer period. Again we can find social and political problems as main themes. He attacks both *left* party and *Five-Star Movement*, stressing the big problem related to migration: this is coherent with *League* ideas. Indeed, from the geographical analysis we will see that VITTOREGUIDI wrote tweets mention North and Central Italy regions, where the *League* (right) party won the elections.

## GATTISILGATTI

GATTISILGATTI is definitely the most relevant character in terms of different topics. He does not seem to support a particular party, but we selected him since his tweets cover the larger range of different topics. His tweets range from corruption to terrorism, from politics to social problems.
